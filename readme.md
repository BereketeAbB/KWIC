To get started with the KWIC (Key Word In Context) application, follow these steps:

Install Node.js on your machine.

Install ts-node by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
npm install -g ts-node
```

In the same directory, locate the data-lines.txt file. Open it and add the lines of data that you want to process using the KWIC algorithm. Each line should contain the text you want to analyze.

After adding the lines to data-lines.txt, go back to the terminal or command prompt and run the following command: node kwic.ts. This will execute the KWIC application and generate the desired output.

```
ts-node .\kwic-modularization-one.ts
```
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and configurations in place for the KWIC application to run successfully. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation or seek assistance from the application's developer.
