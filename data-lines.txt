One of the main characteristics of love is self-sacrifice.
If a person is ready to die for his beloved one, then he loves.
If he is not ready to die, then this is something else.
For a loving person, such sacrifice is not burdensome, but sweet.
A loving person is ready to suffer voluntarily in order to please his beloved one and is even happy to suffer.
After all, as far as gifts are concerned, it is more pleasant to give them then to receive.
Thus, the point of human happiness is in love.
However, people have committed some deeds that are contrary to love and let egotism into their hearts.
I say it again, love is one's readiness to die for the beloved one, while egotism is readiness to kill the beloved one for one's own sake.
This was the reason why paradise was lost.
Egotism is the reason why we all suffer here on earth.
God does not punish us.
We ourselves came to this!
